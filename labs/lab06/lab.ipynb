    "\n",
    "Welcome to the sixth DSC 80 lab this quarter!\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Unlike in DSC 10, labs will have both public tests and hidden tests.** The bulk of your grade will come from your scores on hidden tests, which you will only see on Gradescope after the assignment deadline.\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2025-sp).\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab, as long as they also end up in `lab.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To ensure that all of the work you want to submit is in `lab.py`, we've included a script named `lab-validation.py` in the lab folder. You shouldn't edit it, but instead, you should call it from the command line (e.g. the Terminal) to test your work.** More details on its usage are given at the bottom of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing code from `lab.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below, we import the `.py` file that's contained in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "* We use the `autoreload` notebook extension to make changes to our `lab.py` file immediately available in our notebook. Without this extension, we would need to restart the notebook kernel to see any changes to `lab.py` in the notebook.\n",
    "    - `autoreload` is necessary because, upon import, `lab.py` is compiled to bytecode (in the directory `__pycache__`). Subsequent imports of `lab` merely import the existing compiled python.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Note: </b> For this lab, due to system constraints, the code may take varying amounts of time to run on different machines. If you are able to submit to Gradescope and the code runs, then you have met the runtime requirements.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Question 2, you'll spend plenty of time parsing HTML source code. But before you get your hands dirty trying to extract information from HTML written by other people, it is a good idea to write basic HTML code yourself. This exercise will help you better understand how the code in a `.html` file is structured.\n",

    "- It must have `<title>` and `<head>` tags.\n",
    "- It must also have `<body>` tags. Within the `<body>` tags, it must have:\n",

    "    * At least three references (hyperlinks) to different web pages.\n",
    "    * At least one table with two rows and two columns.\n",
    "    \n",

    "## Question 3 – API Requests 🤑\n",
    "\n",
    "You trade stocks as a hobby. As an avid `pandas` coder, you decide to calculate statistics of your favorite stocks by pulling data from a public API. The API we will work with can be found at https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/#Stock-Historical-Price. Specifically, we will use the \"**Daily Chart EOD**\" endpoint (search for it at the linked page).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some relevant definitions:\n",
    "- Ticker: A short code that refers to a stock. For example, Apple's ticker is AAPL and Ford's ticker is F. \n",
    "- Open: The price of a stock at the beginning of a trading day.\n",
    "- Close: The price of a stock at the end of a trading day.\n",
    "- Volume: The total number of shares traded in a day.\n",
    "- Percent change: The difference in price with respect to the original price, as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make requests to the aforementioned API, you will need an API key. In order to get one, you will need to make an account at the website. Once you've signed up, you can use the API key that comes with the free plan. It has a limit of 250 requests per day, which should be more than enough. You will have to encode your API key in the URL that you make requests to; see a complete example of such a request at the right side of the [documentation](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#Stock-Historical-Price).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the following two functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `stock_history`\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the implementation of the function `stock_history`, which takes in a string `ticker` and two integers, `year` and `month`, and returns a DataFrame containing the price history for that stock in that month. Keep all of the attributes that are returned by the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Notes***:\n",
    "- Read the API documentation if you get stuck!\n",
    "- [`pd.date_range`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.date_range.html) takes in two dates and returns a sequence of all dates between the two dates, excluding the right endpoint. How might this be helpful?\n",
    "- The [`requests.get`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/) function returns a Response object, not the data itself. Use the `json` method on the Response object to extract the relevant JSON, as we did in [Lecture 9](https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec09/lec09-filled.html#Example:-GET-requests-via-requests) (you don't need to `import json` to do this).\n",
    "- You can instantiate a DataFrame using a sequence of dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `stock_stats`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function `stock_stats` that takes in a DataFrame outputted by `stock_history` and returns a **tuple** of two numbers:\n",
    "1. The percent change of the stock throughout the month as a **percentage**.\n",
    "2. An estimate of the total transaction volume **in billion of dollars** for that month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both values in the tuple should be **strings** that contain numbers rounded to two decimal places. Add a plus or minus sign in front of the percent change, and make sure that the total transaction volume string ends in a `'B'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To compute the percent change**, use the opening price on the first day of the month as the starting price and the closing price on the last day of the month as the ending price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To compute the total transaction volume**, assume that on any given day, the average price of a share is the midpoint of the high and low price for that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Estimated Total Transaction Volume (in dollars)} = \\text{Volume (number of shares traded)} \\times \\text{Average Price} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose there are only three days in March – March 1st, March 2nd, and March 3rd.\n",
    "\n",
    "If BYND (Beyond Meat) opens at \\\\$4 on March 1st and closes at \\\\$5 on March 3rd, its percent change for the month of March is $$\\frac{\\$5-\\$4}{\\$4} = +25.00\\%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the high and low prices and volumes of BYND on each day are given below.\n",
    "- March 1st: high \\\\$5, low \\\\$3, volume 500 million (0.5 billion)\n",
    "- March 2nd: high \\\\$5.5, low \\\\$2.5, volume 1 billion\n",
    "- March 3rd: high \\\\$5.25, low \\\\$4, volume 500 million (0.5 billion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the estimated total transaction volume is\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\$5 + \\$3}{2} \\cdot 0.5 B + \\frac{\\$5.5 + \\$2.5}{2} \\cdot 1 B + \\frac{\\$5.25 + \\$4}{2} \\cdot 0.5 B = 8.3125B$$"

    "You regularly browse [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to keep up with the latest news in tech. One link to a Hacker News article is https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18344932. Note that this article has 18 comments and has a `storyid` of 18344932.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem now is that you don't have internet access on your phone during your morning commute to work, so you want to save the interesting stories' comment threads beforehand in a CSV. You find their [API documentation](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and decide to get to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the implementation of the function `get_comments`, which takes in a `storyid` and returns a DataFrame of all the comments below the news story. You can ignore \"dead\" comments(you will know them when you see them), as well as \"dead\" comments’ children. **Make sure the order of the comments in your DataFrame is from top to bottom just as you see on the website**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame that `get_comments` returns should have 5 columns:\n",
    "1. `'id'`: The unique ID of the comment.\n",
    "2. `'by'`: The author of the comment.\n",
    "3. `'text'`: The actual comment.\n",
    "4. `'parent'`: The unique ID of the comment this comment is replying to.\n",
    "5. `'time'`: When the comment was created (in `pd.Timestamp` format).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some guidance:\n",
    "1. The URL to make requests to is `'https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{}.json'`, however, the `{}` should be replaced with the ID of the article or page you are trying to access. \n",
    "2. Again, do not `import json` – instead, use the `json` method on the Response object you get back.\n",
    "3. Use depth-first search when traversing the comments tree. You will have to do this manually, since you cannot use Beautiful Soup (which is only for HTML documents, not JSON objects).\n",
    "4. Make sure the length of your returned DataFrame is the same as value for the `'descendants'` key in the response JSON (both of which correspond to the number of comments for the story).\n",
    "5. You are allowed to use loops in this function. You may also want to create at least one helper function.\n",
