    "\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook, and **you will only submit that `lab.py` file**, not this notebook!\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Note: For Lab 5 only, there are no hidden tests!</b> The tests you see when you run <code>grader.check</code> are the final tests that will determine your grade. In addition, when you submit Lab 5 to Gradescope you will see your final score on the assignment right away. (This is because the lab is due very close to the Midterm Exam.)\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidelines:\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `lab.py` file!** The functions in the `lab.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2025-sp).\n",
    "- Notebooks are nice for testing and experimenting with different implementations before designing your function in your `lab.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the `lab.py` file, since that's all you're submitting.\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `lab.py`, we've provided an additional uneditable notebook, called `lab-validation.ipynb`, that contains only the tests and their setup. Make sure you are able to run it top-to-bottom without error before submitting!**\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab, as long as they also end up in `lab.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing code from `lab.py`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Below, we import the `.py` file that's contained in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "* We use the `autoreload` notebook extension to make changes to our `lab.py` file immediately available in our notebook. Without this extension, we would need to restart the notebook kernel to see any changes to `lab.py` in the notebook.\n",
    "    - `autoreload` is necessary because, upon import, `lab.py` is compiled to bytecode (in the directory `__pycache__`). Subsequent imports of `lab` merely import the existing compiled python."

    "### Missing by Design (MD)\n",
    "- The missing field is deliberately missing. The missing field is deliberately set to null or not collected (hence, \"missing by design\").\n",
    "- The missingness can be exactly predicted when a column will be null, with only knowledge of the other columns using a function of the rows of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of missing value isn't related to the actual, unreported value itself, nor the values in any other fields. The missingness is not systematic.\n",
    "- The missingness is unconditionally uniform across rows. MCAR doesn't bias the observed data.\n",
    "- There is no relationship between the missing data and the any of the other data, observed or missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing at Random (MAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of the missing value has nothing to do with the value itself, but may be related to another field.\n",
    "- The missingness is uniform across rows, perhaps conditional on another column. MAR biases the observed data, but is fixable.\n",
    "- There is a systematic relationship between the missing values and the observed data (but not the missing values themselves).\n",
    "- Difference between MD and MAR: If you can *exactly/always* determine missingness using the other columns, the missingness is MD. If there is just some sort of systematic relationship between the missing columns/values and other columns/values that may help us predict missingness, the missingness is MAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not Missing At Random (NMAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of the missing value is related to the actual, unreported value.\n",
    "- NMAR biases the observed data in unobservable ways.\n",
    "- There is relationship between the propensity of a value to be missing and its value."

    "### Question 1 – After-Purchase Surveys 🛒\n",
    "\n",
    "You run a small e-commerce website and send surveys out to customers after they purchase an item from your store. The survey asks whether the customer is satisfied with their purchase (\"Yes\" or \"No\"). Below, you are presented with possible datasets, each of which contains a column `'satisfied'` as described above, as well as a `'customer_id'` number corresponding to the customer and an `'item'` column describing the item that the customer purchased. **The column `'satisfied'` is missing data.**\n",

If you are unsure, ask a tutor, but be prepared to provide justification for whichever answer(s) you think might be right.\n",

    "### Question 4 – Missing Heights 🕵️\n",
    "\n",
    "In the file `data/missing_heights.csv` are the heights of adult children and their fathers (`'child'` and `'father'`). The additional `'child_X'` columns are missing values in varying proportions; for each X, `'child_X'` is X\\% not missing (and hence (100-X)\\% missing). **The missingness of these `'child_X'` columns were created as MAR dependent on father's heights (similar to what was done in [Lecture 8](https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec08/lec08.html)). The missingness of these `'child_X'` columns are all equally dependent on father's heights.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will attempt to **verify** the missingness of the `'child_X'` columns as being dependent on the `'father'` column by using permutation tests. Your permutation tests should use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. You can use `scipy.stats`' built-in K-S function to run your permutation tests and compute your p-values; you don't need to simulate manually using a `for`-loop, instead you can directly use `.pvalue` attribute after calling **k2_samp**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, complete the implementation of the function `verify_child`, which takes in the `heights` DataFrame and returns a Series of p-values from your permutation tests, indexed by the names of the columns in `heights` that are formatted like `'child_X'` (that is, its index should be `'child_95'`, `'child_90'`, ..., `'child_5'`; the order of the Series is not important).\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, for each `child_X` column, you will be running one permutation test comparing it to the `father` column. Unlike in Question 3, your permutation tests should run within your `verify_child` function. You can **only** use a for-loop to loop over the **columns** of `heights`, and you shouldn't need to use a `for`-loop to conduct your permutation tests."

We should be precise – we cannot **prove** that heights are MCAR or MAR, just like we cannot prove either hypothesis in a hypothesis test.

That is, for each distinct value of the **categorical** column, there is a single imputed value.\n",

    "You will work with a version of the `heights` DataFrame, `new_heights`, that has a `'father'` column and a single `'child'` column. The `'child'` column has missing values. To impute the `'child'` column, transform the `'father'` column into a categorical column by binning the values of `'father'` into [quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile). Once this is done, you can impute `'child'` as in lecture (and described above).\n",

    "### Question 6 – Probabilistic Imputation 🎲\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Lecture 8](https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec08/lec08.html), you learned how to impute a quantitative column by sampling from the observed values. **One problem with this technique is that the imputation will never generate imputed values that weren't already in the dataset.** For example, 57, 57.5, and 59 are values in the `'child'` column of `new_heights` while 58 is not. Thus, any imputation done by sampling from the observed values in the `'child'` column will not be able to generate a height of 58, even though it's clearly a reasonable value to occur in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, you will impute the `'child'` column **unconditionally** from the distribution of `'child'` heights present in the dataset. This means that you will use the values present in `'child'` to impute missing values, without looking at other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach to quantitative imputation that overcomes the limitation mentioned above is as follows:\n",
    "- Create a histogram of observed `'child'` heights, using 10 bins.\n",
    "- Use the histogram to generate a number within the observed range of `'child'` heights:\n",
    "    - The likelihood a generated number belongs to a given bin is equal to the area of that bin. (Remember, in histograms, areas are proportions.)\n",
    "    - Any number within a fixed bin is equally likely to occur.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's illustrate this approach with an example. Let `demo` be the array of 10 numbers defined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "demo = np.array([10, 11, 11, 13, 14, 14, 13.5, 14, 15, 16])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first step is creating a histogram of `demo`. Note that with this small dataset, we will use 3 bins, but you will be using 10 bins in your imputation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='imgs/demo_histogram.png' width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note that in your process, you don't actually need to draw a histogram – instead, use `np.histogram`.\n",
    "- In the histogram above, we see that $2 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.3 = 30\\%$ of values lie in the [10, 12) bin, $2 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.2 = 20\\%$ of values lie in the [12, 14) bin, and $2 \\cdot 0.25 = 0.5 = 50\\%$ of values lie in the [14, 16] bin.\n",
    "- Next, we need to pick a bin at random. There's a 30\\% chance we pick the [10, 12) bin, a 20\\% chance we pick the [12, 14) bin, and a 50\\% chance we pick the [14, 16] bin. `np.random.choice` will be helpful in picking a bin at random.\n",
    "- Once we pick a bin, we pick a number **uniformly at random** from within the bin. For instance, suppose we randomly chose the [14, 16] bin in the previous step. We then must select a (real) number between 14 and 16 uniformly at random. `np.random.uniform` can help you here.\n",

    "Complete the implementation of the function `quantitative_distribution`, which takes in a Series, `child`, in which some values are missing, and a positive integer `N`, and returns an **array** of `N` imputed values using the method described above. \n",
